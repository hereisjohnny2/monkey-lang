# Monkey Lang

This project is based on the book called [Writing an Interpreter in Go](), by Thorsten Ball. The main idea here is put in pratice the ideas from the book using the GoLang and create an interpreted language call **Monkey**. 

## Getting Started

In a terminal, after cloning the repository, run:

```shell
$ go run .
```

## Tests

Like most of the Go projects we see around, this project is supported by tests (write tests in Go is so easy that :D)

```shell
$ go test ./...
```
